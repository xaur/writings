# Decred for Custody Providers

Here I explain why Decred is a perfect match for cryptocurrency custody providers. Key points come first so you can decide whether to read the details that follow.

Key points for custody clients:

* Client funds secured by robust tech
* Stakeholder voting rights, have a say in project direction
* Earn ~13% annual DCR rewards for voting
* Preserve value

Key points for custody provider:

* Get more clients by offering a unique service
* Earn voting fees on top of custody fees
* Developers: competent, easy to reach, proven track record
* Low risk: working product, live 2+ years, hard fork resistance, clean and tested codebase, active development
* Good PR for supporting innovative projects that solve hard problems, deliver and stay around

# For the Clients

## Client funds secured by robust tech

Decred is not a utility token, its domain is store of value. Therefore its top priority is the security of value storage and transmission.

Clients who prefer security of their funds above everything else will love the following technical properties:

* Network is secured by Proof of Work ASIC miners from 4 manufacturers. Hashrate went from 0.4 to 60 PH/s this year. 4 more manufacturers to come.
* Proof of Stake layer makes it even [more expensive](https://medium.com/decred/decreds-hybrid-protocol-a-superior-deterrent-to-majority-attacks-9421bf486292) to attack the network. Unlike pure PoW currencies like Bitcoin, Decred blocks require confirmations from coin holders.
* No complex error prone smart contracts are involved.
* Mainnet is working for 2 years with no major issues.
* High code quality. Codebase is well tested and documented, written in modern programming language that eliminates a whole class of memory-related bugs.

## Voting rights and rewards

Holding Decred grants voting rights that allow holders to influence how the network evolves technically, and in the near future how the project fund is spent. This requires holders to educate themselves and participate, but in return they receive ~13% annual DCR rewards. The number is approximate as of writing and is trending down, but annually 5-10% is expected even 2 years from now. The rewards mitigate supply inflation to a degree, unlike pure Proof of Work coins where all inflation goes to miners.

To maximize participation and rewards users need to re-deposit chunks of DCR every 30 days on average. Each chunk is worth $4,500 as of writing. Large holdings result in many chunks that require re-depositing every day. To save from routine, users have a choice: either leave voting wallet running 24/7 for max rewards, or re-deposit manually on occasions. The latter removes the need to maintain an always running computer and increases security, at the cost of some rewards.

Custody provider is in the perfect position to maintain always running wallets that continuously re-deposit DCR and cast votes on behalf of clients.

## Preserve value

Decred is consistently in top positions in [% down from all-time high](https://onchainfx.com/v/nzhsrD) chart, and is number 1 if non-currencies are excluded.

Clients of custodian services are likely to look for long term storage. Even if the service is perfectly executed, the health of the underlying asset is fundamental. In addition to technical factors noted above, these social and economic factors contribute to Decred's long term existence and prosperity:

* The project is self-funding, 10% of the block rewards go into a project fund. As of writing, the project fund holds $21 M worth of DCR, which is more than 80% of DCR that has accrued thus far.
* Regulatory risk is lower compared to many tokens due to how the launch was organized (no ICO, tokens had no value at time of airdrop).
* Dozens of active developers.
* One of the least controversial projects in the space by the count of hacks, dramas, lawsuits, broken promises, and such.
* The community is organically growing and helping each other.
* More reasons why people choose Decred are collected in [this compilation](https://medium.com/decred/why-decred-let-the-community-tell-you-5479929e35d2) of community feedback.

# For the Provider

## Get more clients by offering a unique service

The custody provider is in the position to offer a unique service that is only possible in Decred.

Implementing custodial voting requires more engineering effort compared to just custodial storage, but it is not building alone and from zero: there are many developers that can help with advice and some software already exists that can be used as a starting point.

## Earn voting fees on top of custody fees

There are two actions that Decred holder could possibly delegate to his custody provider.

First is continuously re-deposit DCR to maximize voting participation and rewards. Currently users either run a hot wallet 24/7 or give up some rewards by re-depositing on occasions.

Second is voting with the deposited DCR. Each holder's voting wallet needs to be always online in order to quickly respond to calls to vote from the network that happen at unpredictable times. Currently Decred holders pay 1-5% of their voting rewards to services that run voting wallets 24/7 for them.

Custody provider can charge fees for performing both actions on behalf of clients.

## Developers

The developers of Decred have first-hand, proven experience of building blockchain software since 2013 when they developed btcsuite, a from-scratch Bitcoin implementation written in Go language.

They can be easily reached almost any day. In addition, there is an active support chat channel for non-development questions.

## Low risk

* Decred mainnet is live since Feb 2016 and several fundamental promises are already delivered. It is not a whitepaper or promiseware temporary token.
* It is in active development with dozens of developers around the world.
* It is [resistant to hard forks](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7f9ie1/detailed_analysis_of_decred_fork_resistance/) not approved by holders.
* Clean, tested and documented codebase.

The one and only network issue I remember happened last year when the network stalled due to a bug in software of several miners. It was resolved on Sunday (!) within hours. {TODO: Worth keeping?}

## Good PR

Decred tackles on hard problems: secure store of value and decentralized trustless decision making. Supporting innovative projects that deliver and stay around is a contribution to the whole space, and therefore a good basic for positive public perception.

# For Decred Project

Key points:

* Decred becomes accessible to more users
* More engineers touch Decred software, potentially give feedback and contribute
* Good publicity

Let's be fair for a moment. The idea behind cryptocurrency movement is to be your own bank and remove as much middlemen as possible. From this perspective custody may be seen as a step back. I would not expect it to be widely endorsed by the community, or recommended at decred.org. At least not without a big warning sign.

At the same time, we must acknowledge some current obstacles to massive non-custodial cryptocurrency adoption:

* Substantial learning curve
* Software needs more UX, stability and safety improvements
* Few people can use computers securely (non-Windows, non-Intel, etc)

We must also acknowledge that an individual is free to do whatever he wants with his possessions. If he [wishes](https://medium.com/@barmstrong/announcing-coinbase-custody-a-digital-currency-custodian-for-institutions-907166d7af85) to trust his funds to a professional, there is nothing to stop him.

I personally think that as long as people have the choice to be their own bank, custody solutions do not present a problem and should be treated neutrally, or even slightly positive, as they extend the ecosystem and let more people use Decred.
