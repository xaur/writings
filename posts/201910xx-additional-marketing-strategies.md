The price keeps sliding down, social media follower counts are not growing, excellent content generated by our community still gets very few views, and people are still not talking about Decred all over the place.

_(hoping for a catchy opener here)_

Contracts for Ditto phase 2, Marketing 2019 and Events 2019 move to their end. Together with Ditto's phase 1, these 4 marketing proposals are collectively capped at $790,000 for ~1 year. (I deliberately use "capped" because we don't know how much was actually spent, but this is a separate problem*). Note that these expenses are happening at DCR rates that I find very low, so it costs a lot to the Treasury.

The spendings brought us some good results but haven't yet addressed a few big concerns of mine. Thinking what we are missing I've been collecting ideas and organizing them in additional marketing strategies presented below.

## Keep marketing in check

First of all we must know how efficient are our existing marketing efforts. To do that we need to _evaluate_ what was _done_ against certain _criteria_. The former requires _reporting_ and the latter requires defining _success metrics_.

Ditto proposal reports [twice a month](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/tree/master/pr-ditto/updates), which is amazing and is a great example to all proposals.

Marketing and Events proposals _kind of_ report via monthly summaries in Decred Journal but it's far from what I'd like to see. Besides distinct deliverables like Decred Assembly or Decred in Depth releases, summaries for Marketing have incomplete and unclear coverage of how items outlined in the [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e) are progressing. As for Events, the high level reporting is not robust because the summaries are collected by DJ authors and not by proposal owners, and there is no established reporting practice yet. Some people submit full [event reports](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events) (thanks, keep it up!), some post messages in the #events chat room and some don't post explicit reports at all. Sadly, the most expensive events like Consensus are the least willing to report, while the majority of reports comes from smaller low budget events. I would exect a bit more active updates from budgets of this size.

Note that I'm only judging reporting here, not achievements. I see marketing achievements all the time. The problem is I don't know which results were funded by which proposals, I don't have a good overview of results. How can we evaluate efficiency without a convenient, thorough and up-to-date summary of the results we evaluate?

When it comes to success metrics, there were fair calls in [Ditto 1](https://proposals.decred.org/proposal/27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/35), [Ditto 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposal/52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/1) and [Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposal/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/23) to establish those even before we approved the proposals. The problem I saw back then is that numbers can be gamed or may not represent important things. I viewed those proposals as an experiment that we can only begin to evalute after we do it for some time and collect some results. Now is a good time.

I'd like to see more data on how efficient was spending resources on traditional media.

Something I hoped Decred would achieve with Ditto's help is a significant amount of coverage from the ["big boys"](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/cryptocurrency-news-websites/) like CoinDesk and CoinTelegraph.

I wouldn't compare with old and well known topics Bitcoin or Ethereum, but let's compare with smaller projects that seem to have paid PR as well - Stellar and Zcash. For data points let's take the count of tagged articles in 2019:

site|Stellar|Zcash|Decred
:--|--:|--:|--:
CoinDesk|[10](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/stellar)|[19](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/zcash)|[3](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/decred)
CoinTelegraph|[10](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/stellar)|[34](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/zcash)|[2](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/decred)
BTCManager|[3](https://btcmanager.com/tag/stellar/)|[13](https://btcmanager.com/tag/zcash/)|[1](https://btcmanager.com/tag/decred/)
InvestInBlockchain|[26](https://www.investinblockchain.com/tag/stellar/)|[2](https://www.investinblockchain.com/tag/zcash/)|[6](https://www.investinblockchain.com/tag/decred/)

There must be reasons why Decred is not mentioned in major media as often as it should, and I'd like to know those reasons. More importantly, I'd like to know if they worth our time.

More media placements is always good, especially in big places. But crypto sites generate crypto articles all the time. Does Decred stand out from hundreds of other coins covered every day? Do we have any view count stats? Did we onboard any significant number of users or investors or devs fia Forbes, Yahoo Finance or CoinDesk?

To be fair, we got @cryptoleslie via Forbes which is huge.

Big events like Consensus are good to have presence at, but again did they bring us anything?

Some use price as the metric and "bull market" was mentioned in [Ditto 2](https://proposals.decred.org/proposal/52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04) but as of writing we've seen the opposite.

Other metrics that naturally come to mind are social media stats: followers, views, likes, etc. I'll cover those in the section about social media.

## Money

Use "money" much more often. When explaining Decred open with "money" and _later_ mention complex terms like "decentralized superior store of value for generations to come", "self-directed digital currency" or "Secure. Adaptable. Sustainable". Don't throw that away - it's all important and I'm glad we [figured it out](https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr/blob/release/foundational-messaging.md). Just don't start with concepts so distant from everyday life. "Money" sounds stronger than "currency".

Talk about what's going on with traditional money\*. Why prices keep going up despite all our technological progress? Talk about the financial crisis of 2008. Remind when and why Bitcoin launched and what did it have in its first block. Talk about the new QE round from the ECB (is it 4th?) and its-not-QE4-stay-calm from the FRB. Make people look at the bills and cards they use _every day_, and for the first time _think_ where they come from, who creates it and for how long this can keep going until the next major "oopsie".

When the person is ready and begins to appreciate crypto, an fair next question is why not just use a more established currency? And then we must show the difference. In Decred you approve what happens your money system because you are the one risking your wealth by using it\*. This is not true for pure PoW systems where as a holder you have to rely on 3rd parties making good decisions for you. Ironically, crypto was made to remove this trust. Decred, arguably for the first time, gives us a chance to have money that serves _us_\* without security compromises of pure PoS systems.

Because I believe Decred's nearest [major goal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/dgck7e/what_is_decreds_end_goal/) is delivering us sound money, I would not _pitch_ it as "DAO" or anything too distant from sound money. When you set the goal to land on the Moon, you get all kinds of amazing inventions and breakthroughs along the way, but your goal is the Moon.

(traders, apologies for using this metaphor right now)

## Honesty

Be honest about Decred's status. Always be ready to farily present what we _do_ and _do not_ have yet. Decred is _not_ a good SoV today:

- It has low liquidity and low exchange adoption. We do get new integrations every month and liquidity fix is getting closer, but it's a long road.
- Self-custody UX is a huge pain point. Like in all crypto.
- [Privacy](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/25) is not solved yet. I would argue that voting [address reuse](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/311) made Decred _less private_ than Bitcoin. Glad to see it getting attention now because it is required for Decred's CoinShuffle++ rollout. This has potential for much greater and more accessible privacy than in Bitcoin. 
- Also important, and let's not ignore it, the price is down. People _will_ get puzzled if you tell them about SoV and then show the price chart where it is losing not only against USD, but _also_ against BTC\*.

We need clarity on the status. Decred is _building_ a decent SoV and MoE. We build on great _principles_ and we got the incentives right. In this regard Decred is years ahead of the competition, and to me it is the only approach that makes sense and deserves my time. Decred also has a huge lead in technical fundamentals. I would say we're like 40% there in terms of tech, but in terms of awareness and adoption in the economy and society it's &lt; 1%. (I made these numbers up for illustrative purposes).

## Value transfer tool

Don't omit MoE use case from discussions. I believe SoV and MoE depend on each other and don't make sense individually\*.

While DCR is not ready to serve our everyday purchases, it _already_ serves as Transfer of Value (ToV) - the missing step between SoV and MoE\*.

Decred and other coins could and should be used _today_ to power great projects that solve urgent problems\*.

I personally use DCR to support one very promising project and it feels so right with every transfer\*\*, compared to just hoarding my DCR. The project is [EOMA68](https://www.crowdsupply.com/eoma68/micro-desktop) and it is building open, upgradeable and cheap computers (pluggable "computer cards"). A computer must serve its _owner_, be auditable down to the bone to earn owner's trust, be upgradeable to encourage reuse, and the whole ecosystem must be designed with long-term mindset to reduce waste. It's a long road but we need secure devices that we can trust. Or are you going to run sovereign decentralized finance on backdoored laptops and phones? But that's another story\*.

Internet allows people to share and coordinate information. Sound and open money allows people to share and coordinate energy.

I want to see Decred as a value transfer network for builders. We can start small and heavily tip each other for good contributions\*\*. Then it could become [Hacker](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html)'s Coin\*, and then evolve to connect other builders of this world.

## Reach to people to whom it really matters

Do builders and people who need a decent SoV and MoE visit crypto news sites and big crypto events? Sadly I have no idea.

A complementary strategy I would seriously consider is targeted outreach to selected and very relevant groups*. Not automated advertising but targeted awareness push. Train quality representatives/ambassadors, go to these communities and let them know what we're building, and stay in touch in case they wish to learn more.

There are many communities that are already aligned with Decred community's values yet we don't actively talk to them. Just to name a few topics, I mean communities and groups who deeply care about sovereignty, financial sovereignty, unorthodox (non-brainwashed) economic schools, sound monetary policy (and alternatives/complements to their weak currencies), building and maintaining open source/free software (and hardware!) where it is needed most, privacy, building better protocols and services without "surveillance included", small government proponents, off-grid living, etc.

Reach like 100 of such communities and see if it makes a difference.

## At the same time, don't panic

We should keep our heads cool at any price. I'm not saying Ditto or Marketing 2019 is doing useless work or is overpriced. I just don't know. All I see is we need _more_ to move this old trend where Decred is some obscure tech brilliance.

To stay cool, focused and productive (you want the change or what?) I recommend:

- Think and identify **specific issues** and present them to the community.
- Don't mix multiple issues into big scary abstractions. Be like a laser that slices off one problem after another. This is where divide and conquer should be applied.
- If you cant isolate issues, at least present your findings and concerns. Just don't spread FUD in your and others' heads.
- **Avoid fragmentation** of the community and maximize the exposure of any additional marketing efforts.
  - Small **working groups** is okay (we have a ton of them), I'm against **discussing** important issues and hiding efforts to address them in private groups.
  - It is in the best interest of any new effort to get as many eyeballs and support as possible, which can (and should) lead to support from the Treasury and "conversion" of your "competitors".
  - Focus on problems, decisions and actions, not personalities. This is what our direct voting is about, remember?
  - Do not fear to communicate, share and negotiate*.
  - There are cases when sensitive information must not be disclosed until a certain point, but after that point open discussions must flow.
- Stay sober, do not overfocus on _some_ negative trends (price, social media metrics) and become blind to positive trends (more conversations about Decred, more investors, more devs, more research, more events all over the world, network is healthy, dev never stops, etc - I hope you read [DJ](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/)!)

Phew! That was quick typing. Looks like these ideas got tired of sitting in my head for so long.

Thanks for your precious attention!

If you see value in my perspective, or would like to signal that I should finish my drafts (*) sooner, or if you would like to experience the joy of permissionless value transfer (**), I'll happily accept tips here:
